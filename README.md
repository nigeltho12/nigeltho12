# 👋 Hi, I'm Nigel T!

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-t-8a7995244/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

IT professional and systems administrator with a background in networking, endpoint management, and security operations. This GitHub serves as a personal workspace and project archive where I document labs, scripts, configurations, and experiments related to modern IT infrastructure, networking, and defensive security.

I enjoy building and maintaining reliable systems, from configuring network services and identity controls to troubleshooting endpoints and analyzing security telemetry. Most of the work here reflects hands-on learning, problem-solving, and practical exploration rather than polished products.

## 🎯 Objective

This GitHub is primarily a project dump and technical journal. It contains hands-on labs, proof-of-concepts, scripts, notes, and experiments across areas such as:
	•	Networking fundamentals and lab environments
	•	Systems administration and endpoint management
	•	Microsoft 365 and identity-related configurations
	•	Security monitoring, threat analysis, and defensive tooling
	•	Automation and scripting to support IT operations

Projects are added as I explore new tools, reinforce fundamentals, or document solutions to real-world technical problems. The focus is on learning, iteration, and practical understanding rather than perfection.
