# 👋 Hi, I'm Nigel Thompson!

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigel-thompson-8a7995244/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

IT professional and network engineering student with a strong foundation in both networking and cybersecurity. I’m passionate about building, securing, and troubleshooting systems — from configuring switches and firewalls to hunting threats and analyzing logs. Whether it's optimizing uptime or defending infrastructure, I bring curiosity, precision, and drive to every project.

---

## 🎯 Objective
I'm currently pursuing opportunities in networking and cybersecurity — including NOC, network support, SOC analyst, and hybrid infrastructure roles. My goal is to grow into a well-rounded engineer who understands both how networks are built and how they’re attacked. I thrive on hands-on labs, packet captures, SIEM alerts, and scripting solutions that keep systems running smoothly and securely.
